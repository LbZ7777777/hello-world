My first commit is the following transcription (at 0.5 speed) of a public domain song sung by Christmas Songs and Carols - Love to Sing on YouTube (https://youtu.be/3CWJNqyub3o):

Dashing through the snow,
in a one-horse open sleigh,

O'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way.

Bells on bob-tails ring,
Making spirits bright.

What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight, oh!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young.
Take the girls tonight, sing this sleighing song.

Get a bob-tailed bay,
two-forty for his speed,
and hitch him to an open sleigh and you will take the lead, oh!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
